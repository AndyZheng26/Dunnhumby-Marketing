## Introduction:

This project transforms raw Dunnhumby Retail focused consumer data into actionable marketing insights to drive targeted campaigns and improve customer retention. The goal is to leverage 2 years of household-level transaction data from 2,500 frequent shoppers to identify purchasing patterns, measure campaign effectiveness, and optimize future marketing efforts.

- What are the key performance indicators for marketing campaign effectiveness?
- Which product categories demonstrate the strongest customer loyalty and response to promotions?
- How do demographics influence purchasing patterns and promotional engagement?
